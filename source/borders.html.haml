  %title Borders | More Than Just Round Corners
%h1 The Border Property
%h2 Border Radius
%p.round Look Ma No Images!
%p During the days of tables it was a very simple process but with the advent of css and emphasis on semantic markup its been an uphill battle. With the growing support of the specification no longer will we have to rely on complex positioning of background images or javascript libraries.
%h3 Browser Support
%p There is a great article with a #{link_to('Table of CSS3 border-radius Compliance', 'http://muddledramblings.com/table-of-css3-border-radius-compliance/')} which details the current support for the module. In short don't expect to have perfect cross browser support until IE9 is old news. Until then there are a litany of #{link_to('articles', 'http://smashingshare.com/2009/11/10/best-collection-of-css-rounded-corners-tutorials/')} detailing solutions for cross browser round corners, my personal favorite being #{link_to('CSS3 PIE', 'http://css3pie.com/')}.
%h3 The Shape Of Things To Come
%p While not entirely practical I can see some utility in #{link_to('CSS Shapes', 'http://www.css3shapes.com/')}. Ultimately I think the <em>HTML5 Canvas</em> tag or <em>SVG</em> will be of more flexible in this kind of pursuit but these might be a better fit for some projects.

%h3 Browser Support
%p Border radius doesn't work in IE7-8 but whats surprising is that the shapes not requiring a border radius display just fine in IE7-8.
%h2 Border Image
%p CSS Tricks has an excellent article #{link_to('Understanding border-image', 'http://css-tricks.com/6883-understanding-border-image/')} explaining one of the more complicated additions to the CSS3 specification. Following up the article Nora Brown Design created an #{ link_to('interactive css3 border-image demo', 'http://www.norabrowndesign.com/css-experiments/border-image-anim.html')}.

%p Support so far seems to only be in <em>Webkit</em> and <em>Geko</em>.
