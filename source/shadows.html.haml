%p 
  #{image_tag('shadow.jpg', :height => '400', :width => '370', :class => 'shadow image-align-right')} Most designers will probably be gagging at the garish use of drop shadow on this classic piece of American radio history. Just as radio had a lot going on that the listener might not notice so does this page.
  %br
  %input{ :type => 'button', :value => 'Toggle #main Shadows', :class => "toggle-shadows" }
%p 
  The <em>box-shadow</em> module is more than just a simple drop shadow it also allows for inset and even multiple shadows on the same element.
  %br
  %input{ :type => 'button', :value => 'Toggle Vibrant Shadows', :class => "toggle-vibrant-shadows", :title => 'The buttons have an inset shadow!' }
%h3 More than just shadows
%p The uses for the box shadow property go far beyond creating the seaming of depth.

%h3 Browser Support
%p With the exception of IE7-8 all modern browsers support the box shadow property even going back multiple versions.
.flex-box
  .box-1
    %h3 Cross Browser Support
    %p There have been numerous methods over the years for achieving drop shadows in IE7-8 but like round corners they could quickly become a bother to maintain because of the complex positioning. #{ link_to('CSS3 Pie', 'http://css3pie.com/')} shadow rendering is stable if you're interested in a javascript solution.
  .box-2
    %h3 There are differences
    %p Even though there is fairly broad support for the box-shadow you should be aware that there can be noticeable differences in bolder usage of shadows.
    .box-3
      .box-4
        %h4 Webkit Shadow
        %p #{image_tag('webkit-shadow.png')}
      .box-4
        %h4 IE9 Shadow
        %p #{image_tag('ie9-shadow.png', :style => "width: 192px;")}
%h2.text-shadow Text Shadows
%p The text shadow property allows you to define up to ten shadows per element.
%h3 Multi Shadow Example
%p The example below was found at #{ link_to('http://www.css3.info/preview/text-shadow/', 'http://www.css3.info/preview/text-shadow/')}
%h2.fire Text Shadows Are Hot
%h3 Browser Support
%p While not a <em>CSS3</em> feature it might as well be with the lack of attention IE is showing it. <strong>Not even in IE9</strong> do you have access to the text shadow which is a real shame since most other browsers have had it for years.
